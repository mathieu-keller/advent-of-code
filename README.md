# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my collection of solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges! Each year, I tackle the challenges using a mix of programming languages, showcasing different approaches to problem-solving.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by year, with each day’s challenge in its respective folder. Here’s the structure:

```
year/{day}:{challenge name}/{language}/
```

- **year**: The Advent of Code year (e.g., `2023`).
- **{day}:{challenge name}**: The day of the challenge and the challenge title (e.g., `01:Calorie Counting`).
- **{language}**: The programming language used for that specific solution (e.g., `Java`, `Typescript`, `Go`).

Each folder contains:
- Solution files in the specified language.

## Example Structure

Here's an example structure:

```
2015/
├── Day 1: Not Quite Lisp/
│   ├── Java/
│   │   └── solution.java
│   └─── Rust/
│   │   └── solution.rs
└── Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math/
    ├── Typescript/
    │   └── solution.ts
    └── Go/
       └── solution.go
```

## Languages Used

This repository showcases a variety of programming languages, including:
- Java
- Typescript
